# staminoid

a different sort of stamina mechanic.

stamina controls whether a player can sprint or get a speed boost/penalty for various other actions.
a player's stamina is depleted when doing actions and sprinting, and gradually recovers over time.

the maximum amount of stamina a player has, and the recovery rate, are controlled by monoids.
